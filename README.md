# Running Kali Linux on Gitpod

## Description

This project demonstrates how to set up and run Kali Linux on Gitpod. By utilizing Gitpod's cloud development environment, this project enables developers to work with Kali Linux tools directly from their browser without the need for local installation. It offers a pre-configured environment with essential tools for penetration testing and security assessments.

## Features

- Run Kali Linux in a browser-based IDE.
- Pre-installed security and penetration testing tools.
- Easily accessible setup via Gitpod workspace.
- No need for local setup or installation.

## Technologies Used

- **Operating System**: Kali Linux
- **Cloud IDE**: Gitpod
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Web Tools**: NoVNC, Websockify
- **Desktop Environment**: XFCE

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Gitpod account** (for creating workspaces).
- **Internet connection** (for accessing the Gitpod workspace).
- **Basic knowledge of Kali Linux and its tools**.

## Installation

1. **Open Gitpod**: Click on the following link to create a new workspace for this project on Gitpod:
   - [Open this project in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/rijj1/kali)

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - If you're working with your own repository, clone it into your Gitpod workspace:
   
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/rijj1/kali.git
     cd project-name
     ```

3. **Start Kali Linux on Gitpod**:
   - Once inside the Gitpod workspace, the system will automatically build the Docker container and set up Kali Linux in a browser-based environment.

4. **Access Kali Linux**:
   - Use the integrated `NoVNC` viewer to access the XFCE desktop environment. This provides a full desktop experience running Kali Linux in your browser.

## Usage

- **Access the Kali Linux Environment**: After the Gitpod workspace is set up, you can access the Kali Linux desktop through the browser-based VNC viewer provided by NoVNC.

- **Use Kali Linux Tools**: Tools like `nmap`, `metasploit`, `aircrack-ng`, and others will be pre-installed and ready to use for penetration testing and security assessments.

- **Run Commands**: You can use the integrated terminal to run Kali Linux commands and scripts as you would on a local installation.

## Running Tests

To run tests or check the installation of tools in the Kali Linux environment, you can use the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
# Test network scanning with nmap
nmap -v -A 192.168.1.1

# Check Metasploit status
msfconsole
